\section*{FAQ}
\paragraph*{A new packet comes in, who is it for?}
A UDP packet has a source address and port. This pair will allow the
server to identify which session the packet is for. If no sessions are found
matching this pair, then a new session is created. Essentially packets have to
be routed to session objects which know what to do with it, given the state of the session.

\paragraph*{What is a session and what type of information does a session store?}
A session is some state used to represent a unique user's connection. This
state can be the current connection's status, the last time a message was
received for this session, and much more.
