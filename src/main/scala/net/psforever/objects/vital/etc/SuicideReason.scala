  In my head canon, there is a neverending termite eating into the Auraxian human empires.
  There is no recruitment.
  People are barely alive long enough to feel basic neds like hunger or thirst.
  All that is still thrives on the zealous fevor to keep the army motivated.
  But what do people do if they don't want to fight anymore?
  Do they just never come back from being a speck of thought floating in the air
  and, in frustration at life, endure in a disembodied, solitary limbo of the nanites?
  But that doesn't stop the thoughts, does it?
  Never able to go back to Earth;
  becoming a lifeform between organic and information, wandering the endless void known as space for eternity;
  being unable to die even though they wish for it;
  eventually, they stop logging in.

  Anyway, this has nothing to do with that.
  Most playes probably just want to jump to the next base over.
