/**
  * An `Enumeration` of outcomes regarding what actually happened to the damage,
  * complementing normal damage type distinction in directing damage calculations.<br>
  * <br>
  * Although some of the earlier states reflect what sort of damage might perform - `Hit`, `Splash`, etc. -
  * this state is more a communication about how that damage is interpreted by the server.
  * For example, some projectiles:
  * perform `Direct` damage, are reported by `HitMessage` packets, and resolve as `Hit`;
  * or, perform `Direct` damage, are reported by `LashDamage` packets, and resolve as `Lash`.
  * Furthermore, some projectiles:
  * perform `Splash` damage, are reported by `SplashHitMessage` packets, and resolve as `Splash`;
  * or, perform `Aggravated` damage, are reported by `SplashHitMessage` packets
  * and resolve either as `AggravatedDirect` or as `AggravatedSplash`.
