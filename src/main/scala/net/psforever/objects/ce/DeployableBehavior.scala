/**
  * A `trait` mixin to manage the basic lifecycle of `Deployable` entities.<br>
  * <br>
  * Two parts of the deployable lifecycle are supported - building/deployment and dismissal/deconstruction.
  * Furthermore, both parts of the lifecycle can also be broken down into two parts for the purposes of sequencing.
  * The former part can be referred to as "preparation" which, at the least, queues the future part.
  * This latter part can be referred to as "execution" where the the actual process takes place.
  * Internal messaging protocol permits the lifecycle to transition.
  * "Building" of the deployable starts when a `Setup` request is received during the appropriate window of opportunity
  * and queues up a the formal construction event and its packets for a later period (usually a few seconds).
  * After being constructed, the deployable can be deconstructed by receiving such a `Deconstruct` message.
  * As deployables are capable of being owned by the player,
  * in between two two states of being created and deconstructed,
  * deployables may also recognize that their ownership has been changed and go through appropriate element shuffling.
  * That recognition is much easier before having their construction finalized, however.<br>
  * <br>
  * Interaction with the major zone deployable management service is crucial.
  * @see `OwnableByPlayer`
  * @see `ZoneDeployableActor`
