/**
 * Represent a special entity that is carried by the player in certain circumstances.
 * The entity is not a piece of `Equipment` so it does not go into the holsters,
 * does not into the player's inventory,
 * and is not carried in or manipulated by the player's hands.
 * The different game elements it simulates are:
 * a facility's lattice logic unit (LLU),
 * the cavern modules,
 * and the rabbit ball (special game mode).<br>
 * <br>
 * For the lattice logic unit, when a facility is set to generate an LLU upon hack,
 * and an adjacent facility on the lattice provides an accommodating faction connection,
 * the unit gets spawned at the LLU socket within the hacked facility.
 * The LLU socket actually doesn't do anything but keep track of the spawned flag and provide a location.
 * It associates with the faction of the hacker and, carried by other players of the same faction only,
 * must be brought to the control console of a designated facility that is owned by the faction of the hacking empire.
 * If the hack is cancelled through a resecure, the LLU despawns.
 * If the facility is counter-hacked, the active LLU despawns and a new LLU is spawned in the socket.
 * Other empires can not interact with the LLU while it is dropped on the ground and
 * vehicles will be warned and then deconstructed if they linges too long near a dropped LLU.
 * The LLU can not be submerged in water or it will despawn and the hack will cancel.
