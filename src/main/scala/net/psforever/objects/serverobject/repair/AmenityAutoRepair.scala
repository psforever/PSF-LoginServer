/**
  * A mixin for handling the automatic repair functionality of facility amenities.
  * Auto-repair is facilitated primarily as a function of nanite transfer unit (NTU) provisions
  * and is prompted by the amenity itself sustaining damage
  * and being, at some level, capable of being repaired.
  * In major facilities - technology plants, bio labs, etc. -
  * this NTU is obtained from that facility's nanite resource silo.
  * The amenity that wishes to be repaired asks the facility for nanite.
  * The reply comes from the NTU source, or from the facility again.
  * In exchange for the automatic repair, the silo looses some of its NTU stockpile
  * and that entails all of the consequences of losing all of the NTU for the base.
  * In smaller field tower bases, the lack of resource silo should not hinder operations
  * as auto-repair is still carried out nonetheless.
  * The consequences of losing NTU do not apply in this case;
  * the field tower is considered to have unlimited, unshared NTU.
