/**
  * `MiddlewareActor` sits between the raw UDP socket and the "main" actors
  * (either `LoginActor` or `SessionActor`)
  * and handles crypto and control packets.
  * The former side is called the outbound network (the clients); the former is called the inbound local (server).
  * This service sets up cryptography, it decodes incoming packets, it encodes, bundles, or splits outgoing packets,
  * and it handles things like requesting/resending lost packets.
  * Accurate operation of the service is mostly a product of the network being agreeable
  * and allowing packets to arrive correctly.
  * Various subroutines are used to keep track of the predicted offending packets.<br>
  * <br>
  * The cryptographic aspect of the service resolves itself first,
  * exchanging keys and passcodes and challeneges between local and the network.
  * Most of this process occurs without any prior cryptographic setup,
  * relying on the validation of its own exchange to operate.
  * Afterwards its completion,
  * all raw data arriving from the network or leaving to the network will require a cipher
  * based on the previously exchanged data.
  * <br>
  * As packets arrive from local with the intention of being sent out towards the network terminus,
  * they will be pooled into a buffer.
  * Periodically, the buffer contents will be evaluated,
  * and packet data of enough quantity and combined length will be assembled into a singular packet bundle.
  * This bundle will be queued and dispatched towards the network.
  * If the outbound packets do not arrive at the network terminus correctly,
  * the network has a method of dispatching requests for identified missing packets.
  * This side of the communication will keep track of its previously dispatched packets for a "reasonable" amount of time
  * and will respond to those requests if possible by searching its catalog.<br>
  * <br>
  * If the inbound packets do not arrive correctly the first time,
  * after a while, requests for identified mising packets from the network source will occur.
  * Virtually all important packets have a sequence number that bestows on each packet an absolute delivery order.
  * Bundled packets have a subslot number that indicates the total number of subslot packets dispatched to this client
  * as well as the order in which the packets should have been received.
  * If a packet is out of sequence - a future packet, compared to what is being expected - it is buffered.
  * Should the expected packets show up out of order before the buffered is cleared,
  * everything sorts itself out.
  * Unresolved missing sequence entries will often lead to requests for missing packets with anticipated subslots.
  * If these requests do not resolve, there is unfortuantely not much that can be done except grin and bear with it.
