     * A dead player (technically, a "corpse" that can no longer be revived) is embodied

     * The second choice is satisfied by respawning in the same zone while still in a state of still being alive.
     * In this singular case, the player retains his previous globally unique identifier.
     * In all other cases, as indicated, a new globally unique identifier is selected.<br>
     * <br>
     * If the player is alive and mounted in a vehicle, a different can of worms is produced.
