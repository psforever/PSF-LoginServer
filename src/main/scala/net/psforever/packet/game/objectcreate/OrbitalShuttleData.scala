/**
  * A representation of the high altitude rapid transport (HART) shuttle that ferries the player into battle.
  * This `Codec` is different depending on whether the shuttle is the child of a parent or independent.<br>
  * <br>
  * Three HART shuttles dock with the three HART buildings in the three sanctuaries for short periods on a timed schedule.
  * When one is landed, players may board the shuttle using designated hallways in the lobbies of the HART building.
  * After the shuttle leaves the sanctuary, it transports those players up into orbit above the continents.
  * The shuttle docks again, this time with space stations that orbit the planet.
  * It allows infantry to use droppods to land on the continents by pinpointing locations on that continent's tactical map.<br>
  * <br>
  * The previous explanation is smoke and mirrors nonsense.
  * Lore-wise, the separation of Auraxis during the Bending rendered it impossible for the shuttle to visit all of the continents.
  * The orbital stations - even if they multiplied one per planet - don't really exist.
  * (They almost existed but all assets for them were cut from the game.)
  * The HART shuttle also isn't a traditional vehicle.
  * It isn't even tangible.
  * The game just treats it like a vehicle for the purpose of allowing players to access the controllable droppod system.<br>
  * <br>
  * When accessible to the player, the shuttle has an access point called a "trunk."
  * Trying to access it yields the brief message "OSMustBeDockedToMount."
