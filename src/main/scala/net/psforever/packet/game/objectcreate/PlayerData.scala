/**
  * A representation of another player's character for the `ObjectCreateMessage` packet.
  * In general, this packet is used to describe other players.<br>
  * <br>
  * Divisions exist to make the data more manageable.
  * The first division defines the player's location within the game coordinate system.
  * The second division defines features of the character
  * that are shared by both the `ObjectCreateDetailedMessage` version of a controlled player character
  * and the `ObjectCreateMessage` version of a player character (this).
  * The third field provides further information on the appearance of the player character, albeit condensed.
  * The fourth field involves the player's `Equipment` holsters and their inventory.
  * The hand that the player has exposed is last.
  * One of the most compact forms of a player character description is transcribed using this information.<br>
  * <br>
  * The presence or absence of position data as the first division creates a cascading effect
  * causing all of fields in the other two divisions to gain offset values.
  * These offsets exist in the form of `String` and `List` padding.
  * @see `CharacterData`<br>
  *        `InventoryData`<br>
  *        `DrawnSlot`
  * @param pos the optional position of the character in the world environment
  * @param basic_appearance common fields regarding the the character's appearance
  * @param character_data the class-specific data that explains about the character
  * @param inventory the player's inventory;
  *                  typically, only the tools and weapons in the equipment holster slots
  * @param drawn_slot the holster that is initially drawn
  * @param position_defined used by the `Codec` to seed the state of the optional `pos` field
