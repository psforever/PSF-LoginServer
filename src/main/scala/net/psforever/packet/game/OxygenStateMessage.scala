/**
  * Dispatched by the server to cause the player to slowly drown.
  * If the player is mounted in a vehicle at the time, alert the player that the vehicle may be disabled.<br>
  * <br>
  * When a player walks too far underwater, a borderless red progress bar with a countdown from 100 (98) is displayed across the screen.
  * The flavor text reads "Oxygen level".
  * The countdown proceeds to zero at a fixed rate - it takes approximately 60s - and is timed with the depleting progress bar.
  * When it reaches zero, the player will be killed.
  * If the player is in a vehicle after a certain depth, a blue bar and countdown pair will superimpose the red indicators.
  * It depletes much more rapidly than the red indicators - it takes approximately 5s.
  * When it reaches zero, the vehicle will become disabled.
  * All players in the vehicle's seats will be kicked and they will not be allowed back in.<br>
  * <br>
  * Normally, the countdowns should be set to begin at 100 (100.0).
  * This is the earliest the drowning GUI will appear for either blue or red indicators.
  * Greater intervals - up to 204.8 - will start the countdown silently but the GUI will be hidden until 100.0.
  * (The progress indicators will actually appear to start counting from 98.)
  * @param player the player's oxygen state
  * @param vehicle optional oxygen state of the vehicle the player is driving;
  *                the player must be mounted in the vehicle (at start time)
