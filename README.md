# PlanetSide Login Server [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/psforever/PSF-LoginServer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/psforever/PSF-LoginServer) [![Code coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/psforever/PSF-LoginServer/coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/gh/psforever/PSF-LoginServer/) [![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/documentation-master-lightgrey)](https://psforever.github.io/docs/master/index.html)
This project contains the code to run and manage the login and world server roles for PlanetSide 1.
The login server and world server are currently combined for ease of contributing.

![PSForever Login Server banner](https://i.imgur.com/EkbIv5x.png)

The login and world servers are built to work with PlanetSide version 3.15.84.0. Anything older is not guaranteed to work.
Currently there are no releases of the server. You will need to have a development environment set up in order to get it running.
Or you can jump right in and join the [public test server](#connecting-to-the-server-through-the-client)!

## Build Requirements

* SBT 0.13.x
* Scala 2.11.8
* PSCrypto v1.1 - binary DLL (Windows) or Shared Library (Linux) placed in the root directory of the project. See [Downloading PSCrypto](#downloading-pscrypto) to get it set up.

## Setting up a Build Environment
PSF-LoginServer is built using Simple Build Tool (SBT), which allows it to be built on any platform. SBT is the Scala version of Make, but is more powerful as build definitions are written in Scala. SBT is distributed as a Java JAR and the only dependency it has is a JDK.

### Getting the Java Development Kit
This project is tested with the official [JDK 8 from Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). Download and install it for your system in order to start compiling Scala. If you are new to Scala, this may seem strange to be installing Java for Scala. Scala runs on top of the Java Virtual Machine, meaning it generates `.class` and `.jar` files and uses the `java` executable. Essentially, Scala is just a compiler that targets the JVM, which is its runtime.

### Downloading the Scala Development Kit
In order to use scala, you need the compiler `scalac`. This is equivalent to Java's `javac`, but for the Scala language. [Grab the 2.11.8 version from Scala-Lang.org](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/2.11.8.html).
Install this on to your system and the compiler and Scala REPL will be added to your PATH.

### Downloading PSCrypto
The server requires PSCrypto in order to run. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/psforever/PSCrypto/releases/download/v1.1/pscrypto-lib-1.1.zip) and extract the the approprate dll for your operating system to the top level of your source directory (the root directory, not /pslogin/src/main/scala). SBT, IDEA, and Java will automatically find the required libraries when running the server.
If you are not comfortable with compiled binaries, you can [build the libraries yourself](https://github.com/psforever/PSCrypto).

If you have any issues with PSCrypto being detected when trying to run the server try adding `-Djava.library.path=` (no path necessary) to your preferred IDE's build configuration, for example with IDEA: Run -> Edit Configuration -> VM Options

### Using an IDE
Scala code can be fairly complex and a good IDE helps you understand the code and what methods are available for certain types.
IntelliJ IDEA has some of the most mature support for Scala of any IDE today. It has advanced type introspection and excellent code completion. It's recommended for those who are new to Scala in order to get familiar with the syntax.

[Download the community edition of IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)  directly from IntelliJ's website.
Then [follow this tutorial](http://nanxiao.me/en/getting-started-with-scala-in-intellij-idea-14-1/) to get the required Scala plugin for IDEA. Stop at step 2a (project creation) as we will be importing the LoginServer project ourselves.

Next, you need to get a copy of the LoginServer code. It's recommended that you perform a `git clone https://github.com/psforever/PSF-LoginServer.git` using your favorite git tool. You can also work from a ZIP ball, but you cannot develop from it.

Once you have the code downloaded, you will need to import the project into the IDE. Follow these instructions from [IntelliJ to import an SBT project](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.1/getting-started-with-sbt.html#import_project).
Once you have successfully imported the project, navigate to the `pslogin/src/main/scala/PsLogin.scala` file, right click and 'Run PsLogin'. This will boot up the login server.

### Using SBT and a Text Editor
If you are not a fan of big clunky IDEs (IDEA is definitely one of them), you can opt to use your favorite text editor (Sublime, ViM, Notepad++, Atom, etc.) and use SBT to build the project. The only dependency you will need is SBT itself. [Download SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html) for your platform, install or extract, and open up a command line (cmd.exe, bash, CYGWIN, Git Bash) that has the Java Development Kit in its path.

At the command line run the following commands
```
git clone https://github.com/psforever/PSF-LoginServer.git
cd PSF-LoginServer
sbt pslogin/run
```
This will clone the repository and SBT will compile and run the login server. Note: SBT is quite slow at starting up. It's recommended you have an open SBT console in order to avoid this startup time.

### Generating Documentation
Using SBT, you can generate documentation for both the common and pslogin projects using `sbt unidoc`.

Current documentation is available at [https://psforever.github.io/docs/master/index.html](https://psforever.github.io/docs/master/index.html)

## Running the Server

To run a headless, non-interactive server, run

```
sbt pslogin/run
```

PlanetSide can now connect to your server.

To run your custom server with an interactive `scala>` REPL, run

```
sbt pslogin/console
```

To start the server and begin listening for connections, enter the following expression into the REPL:

```
PsLogin.run
```

This process is identical to running the headless, non-interactive server: PlanetSide clients can connect, logging output will be printed to the screen, etc. The advantage is that you now have an interactive REPL that will evaluate any Scala expression you type into it.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16912082/18024339/62197f66-6bcd-11e6-90f7-5569d33472a7.png)

The REPL supports various useful commands. For example, to see the type of an arbitrary expression `foo`, run `:type foo`. To print all members of a type, run `:javap -p some-type`. You can run `:help` to see a full list of commands.

## Connecting to the Server through the Client
To get PlanetSide to connect to your custom server, you will have to navigate to the `client.ini` file (located within the PlanetSide game directory) and modify the IP addresses.

Check to see what IP the server is listening on (look for the `login-udp-endpoint` line) and copy that IP, followed by port 51000 to the the second line of the `client.ini`, which should initially say `login0=64.37.158.81:45000`. Your new line should say `login0=YourIP:51000`.  Delete all of the other lines in the file except `[network]` at the top of the file. Save and enjoy!

The file should now look like this

```ini
[network]
login0=your.local.ip:your-port
```

If you want to connect to the public test server, this is what your file would look like

```ini
[network]
login0=play.psforever.net:51000
```

Afterwards, it is recommended that you create a shortcut to Planetside.exe. Afterwards, right click on the shortcut, select "Properties", and go under the "Shortcut" tab. In there, add these launch arguments in the target box after the quotes:  /K:StagingTest /CC . It should look like this in the target boxa fter you are done: <Directory to your planetside.exe>\planetside.exe" /K:StagingTest /CC . This will allow you to bypass the launcher and directly go to a login screen. /K:StagingTest is the argument that bypasses the launcher, and /CC fixes some errors with certain objects and features related to the Core Combat expansion (like allowing some buildings to appear, ceasing the message that "you must purchase Come Combat", etc.).

As of right now, there is no username/password checking or persistance, so feel free to fill in whatever you like into those boxes. Afterwards, choose your server and select one of the default characters or make your own. There is also no character persistence in the current build of PSForever, so any character you make will be lost when you log out of them.

**You must restart PlanetSide when changing the `client.ini` file!**

## Creating a Release
If you want to test the project without an IDE or deploy it to a server for run, you can use sbt-pack to create a release (included with the repository).
First make sure you have the [SBT tool](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html) on your command line (or create a new task in IntelliJ IDEA). Then get a copy of the source directory (either in ZIP or cloned form). Then do the below

```
cd PSF-LoginServer
sbt packArchiveZip # creates a single zip with resources
```

This will use the sbt-pack plugin to create a JAR file and some helper scripts to run the server. The output for this will be in the `PSF-LoginServer\target` directory. Now you can copy the ZIP file to a server you want to run it on. You will need the Java 8 runtime (JRE only) on the target to run this. In the ZIP file, there is a `bin/` directory with some helper scripts. Run the correct file for your platform (.BAT for Windows and shell script for Unix).

## Troubleshooting

#### Unable to initialize pscrypto
If you get an error like below
```
12:17:28.037 [main] ERROR PsLogin - Unable to initialize pscrypto
java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Unable to load library 'pscrypto': Native library (win32-x86-64/pscrypto.dll) not found in resource path 
```
Then you are missing the native library required to provide cryptographic functions to the login server. To fix this, you need a binary build of [PSCrypto](#downloading-pscrypto).

If you are still having trouble on Linux, try putting the library in `root directory/pscrypto-lib/libpscrypto.so`.
