/**
  * This actor is essentially a bridge between the LoginSessionActor and WorldSessionActor. When
  * a player connects, the LoginSessionActor handles the account login by querying the database,
  * comparing passwords etc, and then by inserting the account information into this actor by a
  * token that is also sent to the player's client in the LoginRespMessage packet. The token is
  * just like a browser cookie session token.
  *
  * When the player's client has processed the LoginRespMessage packet, it attempts to connect
  * to the game world by sending a ConnectToWorldRequestMessage with the token which is used
  * by the WorldSessionActor to lookup the player's account info from this actor.
  *
  * So this actor is a temporary store of account data for players logging into the login
  * server and crossing over to the world server.
