/**
  * A slot-like interface for a specific grid position in an inventory.
  * The size is typically bound to anything that can be stowed which encompasses most all `Equipment`.
  * The capacity of this `EquipmentSlot` is essentially treated as 1x1.
  * Upon insertions, however, the capacity temporarily is treated as the size of the item being inserted (unless `None`).
  * This allows a proper check for insertion collision.<br>
  * <br>
  * Rather than operating on a fixed-size slot, this "slot" represents an inventory region that either includes `slot` or starts at `slot`.
  * When determining the contents of the inventory at `slot`, only that singular cell is checked.
  * When removing an item from `slot`, the item in inventory only has to be positioned in such a way that overlaps with `slot`.
  * When adding an item to `slot`, `slot` is treated as the upper left corner (the initial point) of a larger capacity region.<br>
  * <br>
  * The following diagrams demonstrate the coordinate association:<br>
  * `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - - - - - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - - - - - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - - - - -`<br>
  * `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - - - - - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - r r x - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - - - - -`<br>
  * `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - - s - - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - r r x - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - - i i -`<br>
  * `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - - - - - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - x x x - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - - i i -`<br>
  * `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - - - - - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - - - - - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - - - - -`<br>
  * ... where 's' is the 1x1 slot,
  * 'r' is the corner of any 2x2 item that can be removed ('x' is a potential affected edge),
  * and 'i' is the region checked for a 2x2 insertion into `slot`.
