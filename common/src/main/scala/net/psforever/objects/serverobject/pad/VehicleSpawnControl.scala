/**
  * An `Actor` that handles vehicle spawning orders for a `VehicleSpawnPad`.
  * The basic `VehicleSpawnControl` is the root of a simple tree of "spawn control" objects that chain to each other.
  * Each object performs on (or more than one related) actions upon the vehicle order that was submitted.<br>
  * <br>
  * The purpose of the base actor is to serve as the entry point for the spawning process.
  * A spawn pad receives vehicle orders from an attached `Terminal` object.
  * The control object accepts orders, enqueues them, and,
  * whenever prompted by a previous complete order or by an absence of active orders,
  * will select the first available order to be completed.
  * This order will be "tracked" and will be given to the first functional "spawn control" object of the process.
  * If the process is completed, or is ever aborted by any of the subsequent tasks,
  * control will propagate down back to this control object.
  * @param pad the `VehicleSpawnPad` object being governed
