/**
  * An `Actor` that handles vehicle spawning orders for a `VehicleSpawnPad`.
  * The basic `VehicleSpawnControl` is the root of a simple tree of "spawn control" objects that chain to each other.
  * Each object performs on (or more than one related) actions upon the vehicle order that was submitted.<br>
  * <br>
  * When the vehicle is added into the environment, it is attached to the spawn pad platform.
  * On cue, the trapdoor of the platform will open, and the vehicle will be raised up into plain sight on a group of rails.
  * These actions are actually integrated into previous stages and into later stages of the process.
  * The primary objective to be completed is a specific place to start a frequent message to the other customers.
  * It has failure cases should the driver be in an incorrect state.
  * @param pad the `VehicleSpawnPad` object being governed
