/**
  * An `Actor` that handles vehicle spawning orders for a `VehicleSpawnPad`.
  * The basic `VehicleSpawnControl` is the root of a simple tree of "spawn control" objects that chain to each other.
  * Each object performs on (or more than one related) actions upon the vehicle order that was submitted.<br>
  * <br>
  * This object is the first link in the process chain that spawns the ordered vehicle.
  * It is devoted to causing the prospective driver to become hidden during the first part of the process
  * with the goal of appearing to be "teleported" into the driver seat.
  * It has failure cases should the driver be in an incorrect state.
  * @param pad the `VehicleSpawnPad` object being governed
