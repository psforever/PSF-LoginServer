/**
  * Represent any entity that must have its own valid global unique identifier (GUID) to be functional.<br>
  * <br>
  * The basic design philosophy of the workflow of a GUID at this stage is a deterministic state machine.
  * At the start, an `Exception` will be thrown while the default conditions of the accessor and mutator are maintained.
  * ("The ability to set a new valid GUID".)
  * Only a valid GUID may be set and, once it does, that changes the conditions of the accessor and mutator
  * to one where it will return the valid GUID and one where it will no longer accept a new GUID (valid or invalid).
  * That GUID will continue being the GUID reported by the object, even if another valid GUID tries to be set.
  * (No error or exception will be thrown.)
  * To set a new GUID, the current one must be invalidated with the appropriate function,
  * and this turns both the object and any object reference that can be acquired from the object "stale."
  * Doing this prior to setting the initial valid GUID is fruitless
  * as it restores the object to its default mutation option ("the ability to set a new valid GUID").
  * Access to the GUID is retained.
  * This can be done as many times as is necessary by following the same order of actions.<br>
  * <br>
  * The "staleness" of the object and the "staleness" of the GUID are related.
  * The condition in general indicates that the object has somehow become externally disconnected from its GUID reference
  * though the two still share something similar to their prior relationship internally.
  * Do not expect a "stale" GUID to refer to the same object through some mapping mechanism.
  * Do not expect a "stale" object to give you a GUID that will map back to itself.
  * @throws `NoGUIDException` if a GUID has not yet been assigned
