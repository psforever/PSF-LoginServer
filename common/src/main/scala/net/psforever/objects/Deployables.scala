  /**
    * Distribute information that a deployable has been destroyed.
    * The deployable may not have yet been eliminated from the game world (client or server),
    * but its health is zero and it has entered the conditions where it is nearly irrelevant.<br>
    * <br>
    * The typical use case of this function involves destruction via weapon fire, attributed to a particular player.
    * Contrast this to simply destroying a deployable by being the deployable's owner and using the map icon controls.
    * This function eventually invokes the same routine
    * but mainly goes into effect when the deployable has been destroyed
    * and may still leave a physical component in the game world to be cleaned up later.
    * That is the task `EliminateDeployable` performs.
    * Additionally, since the player who destroyed the deployable isn't necessarily the owner,
    * and the real owner will still be aware of the existence of the deployable,
    * that player must be informed of the loss of the deployable directly.
    * @see `DeployableRemover`
    * @see `Vitality.DamageResolution`
    * @see `LocalResponse.EliminateDeployable`
    * @see `DeconstructDeployable`
    * @param target the deployable that is destroyed
    * @param time length of time that the deployable is allowed to exist in the game world;
    *             `None` indicates the normal un-owned existence time (180 seconds)
