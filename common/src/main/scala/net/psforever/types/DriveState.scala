  * An `Enumeration` of the mobility states of vehicles.<br>

  * In general, two important mobility states exist - `Mobile` and `Deployed`.
  * There are stages of a formal deployment.
  * For any deployment state other than the defined ones, the vehicle assumes it is in one of the transitional states.
  * If the target vehicle has no deployment behavior, a non-`Mobile` value will not affect it.
