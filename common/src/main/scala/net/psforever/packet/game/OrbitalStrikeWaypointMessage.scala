  * To clear a waypoint is to pass the another packet to the client with the same GUID but with no coordinates.
  * Passing new coordinates with that GUID will update the position of the indicated waypoint.
  * If the GUID sent with the packet belongs to the client's avatar that player will be given text overlay instructions:<br>
  * "Press the fire key or button to launch an orbital strike at the waypoint."<br>
  * The text will fade shortly after the waypoint has been cleared.<br>
  * <br>
  * All `OrbitalStrikeWaypointMessage` packets sent to a client will create a waypoint that will be seen by that client.
  * All rendered waypoints, regardless of the users who summoned them, will be seen in the faction color of the client's avatar.
  * (Black OPs orbital strike waypoints are green, as expected.)
  * The server should not notify the wrong clients about another faction's prepared orbital strikes;
  * however, even if it did, those beams would be seen as a same-faction's marker.
  * @param guid coordinates used to identify the waypoint;
  *             ostensibly, the GUID of the player who placed the waypoint
  * @param coords the coordinates of the waypoint;
