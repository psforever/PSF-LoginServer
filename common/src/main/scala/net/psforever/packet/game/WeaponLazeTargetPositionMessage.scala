  * Dispatched to the server when a position is being marked by a laze pointer tool.<br>
  * <br>
  * When the laze tool is used, a progress bar window is displayed, along with the text "Acquiring Target Position."
  * The player using the tool constantly sends packets to the server for as long as the progress bar is filling.
  * In all, about fifty packets are sent.
  * (Measured during low-load testing.
  * The actual number of packets may be related to network load.)<br>
  * <br>
  * While firing, the player's movement is locked for the duration.
  * The weapon fire can be aborted at any time, returning control.
  * @param weapon_uid the laze pointer tool
  * @param player_pos the position of (the player holding the) laze pointer
  * @param lazed_pos position of the tip of the laze pointer's beam, or where it intersects something
