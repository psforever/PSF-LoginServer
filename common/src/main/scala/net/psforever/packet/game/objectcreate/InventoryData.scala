/**
  * A representation of the inventory portion of `ObjectCreateMessage` packet data for avatars.<br>
  * <br>
  * The inventory is a temperamental thing.
  * Items placed into the inventory must follow their proper encoding schematics to the letter.
  * No values are allowed to be misplaced and no unexpected regions of data can be discovered.
  * If there is even a minor failure, the whole of the inventory will fail to translate.<br>
  * <br>
  * Under the official servers, when a new character was generated, the inventory encoded as `0x1C`.
  * This inventory had no size field, no contents, and an indeterminate number of values.
  * This format is no longer supported.
  * Going forward, an empty inventory - approximately `0x10000` - should be used as substitute.<br>
  * <br>
  * Exploration:<br>
  * 4u of ignored bits have been added to the end of the inventory to make up for missing stream length.
  * They do not actually seem to be part of the inventory.
  * Are these bits always at the end of the packet data and what is the significance?
  * @param unk1 na;
  *             `true` to mark the start of the inventory data?
  *             is explicitly declaring the bit necessary when it always seems to be `true`?
  * @param unk2 na
  * @param unk3 na
  * @param contents the actual items in the inventory;
  *                  holster slots are 0-4;
  *                  an inaccessible slot is 5;
  *                  internal capacity is 6-`n`, where `n` is defined by exosuit type and is mapped into a grid
