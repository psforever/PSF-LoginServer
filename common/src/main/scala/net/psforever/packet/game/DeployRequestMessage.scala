/**
  * Dispatched by the client when the player attempts to deploy a vehicle.
  * Dispatched by the server to cause a specific vehicle to be deployed.<br>
  * <br>
  * "Deployment" usually isn't enough by itself.
  * It only changes the physical configuration of the vehicle.
  * (It's an animation request/trigger?)
  * Anything that can be "deployed" does so for a very specific reason, to perform a complex function.
  * These functions are not immediately available.
  * Attributes must be set properly for the transition between behaviors to occur properly.
  * In addition, the recently-deployed vehicles will hang in a state of limbo if not configured properly.
  * It will not even dispatch an un-deploy request upon command in this state.
  * <br>
  * This packet has nothing to do with ACE deployables.
  * @param player_guid the player requesting the deployment
  * @param vehicle_guid the vehicle to be deployed
  * @param deploy_state either requests for a specific deployment state or assignment of the requested state
  * @param unk2 na;
  *             usually 0
  * @param unk3 na
  * @param pos the position where the object will deploy itself
