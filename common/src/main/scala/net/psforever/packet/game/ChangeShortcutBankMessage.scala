  * Switch the set of shortcuts displayed on the HUD's hotbar.<br>
  * <br>
  * The hotbar contains eight slots for user shortcuts - medkits, implants, and text macros.
  * Next to the first slot are up and down arrow buttons with a number.
  * By progressing through the options available from the arrows, eight sets of eight shortcut slots are revealed.
  * Which set is visible determines the effect of the respective binding keys (the Function keys) for the hotbar.
  * Each set is called a "bank," obviously.<br>
  * <br>
  * This packet coordinates the bank number both as an upstream and as a downstream packet.
  * @param player_guid the player
  * @param bank the shortcut bank (zero-indexed);
  *             0-7 are the valid banks
