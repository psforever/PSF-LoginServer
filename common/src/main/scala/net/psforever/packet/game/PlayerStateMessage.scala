/**
  * The server instructs some clients to render a player (usually not that client's avatar) to move in a certain way.<br>
  * <br>
  * This packet instructs the basic aspects of how the player character is positioned and how the player character moves.
  * Each client keeps track of where a character "currently" is according to that client.
  * `pos` reflects an update in regards to where the character should be moved.
  * Data between this "currently" and "new" are interpolated over a fixed time interval.
  * Position and velocity data is standard to normal PlanetSide ranges.
  * All angles follow the convention that every `0x1` is about 2.8125 degrees; so, `0x10` is 45.0 degrees.<br>
  * <br>
  * The avatar model normally moves from where it "currently" is to `pos`.
  * When `vel` is defined, `pos` is treated as where the avatar model starts its animation.
  * In that case, it sppears to teleport to `pos` to carry out the interpolated movement according to `vel`.
  * After the move, it remains at essentially `pos + vel * t`.
  * The repositioning always takes the same amount of time.
  * The player model is left in a walking/running animation (in place) until directed otherwise.<br>
  * <br>
  * If the model must interact with the environment during a velocity-driven move, it copes with local physics.
  * A demonstration of this is what happens when one player "runs past"/"into" another player running up stairs.
  * The climbing player is frequently reported by the other to appear to bounce over that player's head.
  * If the other player is off the ground, passing too near to the observer can cause a rubber band effect on trajectory.
  * This effect is entirely client-side to the observer and affects the moving player in no way.<br>

//TODO the following logic is unimplemented
/*
There is a boolean that is currently unhandled(?) that determines if the packet is aware that this code would run.
If it passes, the first 8-bit value is the number of times the data will be iterated over.
On each pass, a 4-bit value is extracted from the packet and compared against 15.
When 15 is read, an 8-bit value is read on that same turn.
On each subsequent turn, 8-bit values will be read until the number of iterations or until there is an exception.
Until I find a packet that responds somehow, I have no clue what any of this is supposed to do.
