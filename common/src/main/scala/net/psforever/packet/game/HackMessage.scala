  * Dispatched by the server to control the progress of hacking.
  * While "hacking" is typically performed against enemy targets,
  * some actions that involve ally on ally hacking can occur.
  * In this sense, hacking can be consider change progress.<br>
  * <br>
  * In general, the act of hacking is maintained by the server but the conclusion is managed by the client.
  * Hacking typically locks the player into a cancellable firing animation and works as all-or-nothing.
  * The progress bar window is displayed and updated each tick by the server; but, the client can cancel it on its own.
  * When hacking is complete as indicated by the appropriate `HackState`,
  * the client performs the intended action upon the target.
  * Facility amenities will temporarily ignore IFF requirements;
  * vehicles will permanently transfer control over to the hack-starter's empire;
  * facility turret weapons will temporarily convert to their anti-vehicle or anti-aircraft configurations;
  * facilities will be compromised and begin the long process of converting to the hack-starter's empire;
  * and, so forth.<br>
  * <br>
  * As mentioned, one of the unexpected uses of this message
  * will assist the conversion of allied facility turreted weapons to their upgraded armaments.
