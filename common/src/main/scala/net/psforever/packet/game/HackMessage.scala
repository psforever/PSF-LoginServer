/**
  * Dispatched by the server to control the process of hacking.<br>
  * <br>
  * Part of the hacking process is regulated by the server while another part of it is automatically reset by the client.
  * The visibility, update, and closing of the hacking progress bar must be handled manually, for each tick.
  * When hacking is complete, using the appropriate `HackState` will cue the target to be affected by the hack.
  * Terminals and door IFF panels will temporarily expose their functionality;
  * the faction association of vehicles will be converted permanently;
  * a protracted process of a base conversion will be enacted; etc..
  * This transfer of faction association occurs to align the target with the faction of the hacking player (as indicated).
  * The client will select the faction without needing to be explicitly told
  * and will select the appropriate action to enact upon the target.
  * Upon the hack's completion, the target on the client will automatically revert back to its original state, if possible.
  * (It will still be necessary to alert this change from the server's perspective.)
