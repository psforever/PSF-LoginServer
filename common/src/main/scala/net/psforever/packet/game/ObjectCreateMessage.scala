/**
  * Communicate with the client that a certain object with certain properties is to be created.
  * In general, `ObjectCreateMessage` and its counterpart `ObjectCreateDetailedMessage` should look similar.<br>
  * <br>
  * `ObjectCreateMessage` is capable of creating every non-environmental object in the game through the use of encoding patterns.
  * The objects produced by this packet generally do not always fully express all the complexities of the object class.
  * With respect to a client's avatar, all of the items in his inventory are given thorough detail so that the client can account for their interaction.
  * The "shallow" objects produced by this packet are not like that.
  * They express only the essential information necessary for client interaction when the client interacts with them.
  * For example, a weapon defined by this packet may not care internally what fire mode it is in or how much ammunition it has.
  * Such a weapon is not in the client's player's holster or inventory.
  * It is imperceptive information to which he would not currently have access.
  * An `0x17` game object is, therefore, a game object with only the essential data exposed.<br>
  * <br>
  * When interacting with an `0x17` game object, the server will swap back and forth between it and an `0x18` object.
  * (Or it will be removed when it is placed somewhere a given client will no longer be able to see it.)
  * The purpose of this conversion is to control network traffic and object agency.
  * It is not necessary to keep track of all objects on every player on every client individually.
  * This relates to the goal of this packet exposing only "essential data."
  * One player does not need to know how much ammunition remains in a weapon belonging to another player normally.
  * One player also does not need to know how much ammunition is used up when another player reloads their weapon.
  * The only way the first player will know is when the weapon is transferred into his own inventory.
  * All other clients are spared micromanagement of the hypothetical other player's weapon.
  * Updated information is only made available when and where it is needed.<br>
  * <br>
  * Knowing the object's type is necessary for proper parsing.
  * If the object does not have encoding information or is unknown, it will not translate between byte data and a game object.
  * @param streamLength the total length of the data that composes this packet in bits;
  *                     exclude the opcode (1 byte) and end padding (0-7 bits);
  *                     when encoding, it will be calculated automatically
  * @param objectClass the code for the type of object being constructed;
  *                    always an 11-bit LE value
  * @param guid the GUID this object will be assigned
  * @param parentInfo if defined, the relationship between this object and another object (its parent)
  * @param data the data used to construct this type of object;
  *             on decoding, set to `None` if the process failed
  * @see ObjectCreateDetailedMessage
  * @see ObjectCreateMessageParent
