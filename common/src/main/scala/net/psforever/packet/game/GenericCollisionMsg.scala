  * Collision information reports about two subjects who were involved in an altercation.
  * The first is the `player`, that is, the client's avatar.
  * The second is the `target` with respect to the `player` - whatever the avatar ran into, or whatever ran into the avatar.
  * In the case of isolated forms of collision such as fall damage the `target` fields are blank or zero'd.
