/**
  * Dispatched to the server when a type of effect that influence multiple targets activates.<br>
  * <br>
  * Splash does not refer to the effect upon an applicable target.
  * Splash denotes the fixed radius wherein a said effect exerts temporary influence.
  * Being damaged is the most common splash effect; the jammering effect is another.
  * A pain field does not count because it is an environmental constant.
  * Lashing is considered different because it is a type of inheritable influence.<br>
  * <br>
  * Valid targets for splash are all interactive game objects that maintain a GUID.
  * This includes: players, of course; vehicles, of course; doors; terminals; spawn tubes; and, such objects.
  * Not all targets listed will actually be influenced by the effect carried by splash.<br>
  * <br>
  * The effect commonly modifies the visual depiction of the splash.
  * Being able to "see" splash also does not necessarily mean that one will be influenced by it.
  * Visually and spatially, it may seem to bleed through surfaces on occasion.
  * The effect will not be carried, however.
  * Splash will also respect the game's internal zoning and not pass through temporary obstacles like closed doors.
  * Not being able to see splash also does not stop a target from being affected.
  * The radius of influence is typically a bit larger than the visual indication.<br>
  * <br>
  * All sources of splash damage herein will be called "grenades" for simplicity.
  * @param unk1 na
  * @param projectile_uid the grenade's object
  * @param projectile_pos the position where the grenade landed (where it is)
  * @param unk2 na;
  *             frequently 42
  * @param unk3 na;
  *             frequently 0
  * @param projectile_vel the velocity of the grenade when it landed
  * @param unk4 na
  * @param targets a `List` of all targets influenced by the splash
