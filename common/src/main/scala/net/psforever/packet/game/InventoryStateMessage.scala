/**
  * Dispatched by the server to update the value associated with an object in a specific container object.<br>
  * <br>
  * The object indicated by `object_guid` must be associated with the inventory (`container_guid`) at the time.
  * A common use for this packet is to update weapon data when gaining control over that weapon.
  * For example, before boarding any kind of turret for the first time, it's ammunition component will have exactly one shot.
  * This shot was established when the turret was first created.
  * This information would be displayed in the holster icon across the bottom of the GUI while it is mounted.
  * Furthermore, the mounted player will only fire the turret exactly one time.
  * This packet can provide the turret with its correct and current amount of ammunition before the player mounts it.
  * @param object_guid the object being affected
  * @param unk na;
  *            usually 0
  * @param container_guid the object in which `object_guid` is contained
  * @param value an amount with which to update `object_guid`
