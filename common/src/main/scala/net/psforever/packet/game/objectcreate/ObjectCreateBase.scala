/**
  * The parent information of a created object.<br>
  * <br>
  * In normal packet data order, there are two ways the parent object can be assigned.
  * The first is an implicit association between a parent object and a child object that are both created at the same time.
  * A player character object, for example, is initialized in the same breath as the objects in his inventory are initialized.
  * A weapon object is constructed with an ammunition object already included within itself.
  * The second is an explicit association between the child and the parent where the parent exists before the child is created.
  * When a new inventory object is produced, it is usually assigned to some other existing object's inventory.
  * That is the relationship to the role of "parent" that this object defines.
  * As such, only its current unique identifier needs to be provided.
  * If the parent can not be found, the child object is not created.<br>
  * <br>
  * A third form of parent object to child object association involves the impromptu assignment of an existing child to an existing parent.
  * Since no objects are being created, that is unrelated to `ObjectCreateMessage`.
  * Refer to `ObjectAttachMessage`, `MountVehicleMsg`, and `MountVehicleCargoMsg`.<br>
  * <br>
  * When associated, the child object is "attached" to the parent object at a specific location called a "slot."
  * "Slots" are internal to the object and are (typically) invisible to the player.
  * Any game object can possess any number of "slots" that serve specific purposes.
  * Player objects have equipment holsters and grid inventory capacity.
  * Weapon objects have magazine feed positions.
  * Vehicle objects have seating for players and trunk inventory capacity.
  * @param guid the GUID of the parent object
  * @param slot a parent-defined slot identifier that explains where the child is to be attached to the parent;
  *             encoded as the length field of a Pascal string
