/**
  * Dispatched by the server to promote a warp gate's broadcast functionality.<br>
  * <br>
  * Changes the map name of a warp gate into "Broadcast"
  * and allow a given faction to access the gate's intercontinental transport functionality to/from that gate,
  * even if the gate is not properly owned.
  * If an actual warp gate is not designated, nothing happens.
  * If not set, the map name of the warp gate will default to whatever is normally written on the map.
  * The map designation of geowarps is not affected by this packet.
  * @see `BuildingInfoUpdateMessage`
  * @param zone_id the zone ordinal number
  * @param building_id the warp gate map id
  * @param tr players belonging to the Terran Republic interact with this warp gate as a "broadcast gate"
  * @param nc players belonging to the New Conglomerate interact with this warp gate as a "broadcast gate"
  * @param vs players belonging to the Vanu Sovereignty interact with this warp gate as a "broadcast gate"
