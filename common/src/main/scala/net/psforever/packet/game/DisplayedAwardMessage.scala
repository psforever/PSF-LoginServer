  * Dispatched to configure a player's merit commendation ribbons.<br>

  * Normally, this packet is dispatched by the client when managing merit commendations through the "Character Info/Achievements" tab.
  * On Gemini Live, this packet was also always dispatched once by the server during character login.
  * It set the term of service ribbon explicitly.
  * Generally, this was unnecessary, as the encoded character data maintains information about displayed ribbons.
  * This behavior was probably a routine that ensured that correct yearly progression was tracked if the player earned it while offline.
  * It never set any of the other ribbon slot positions during login.<br>
  * <br>
  * A specific ribbon may only be set once to one slot.
  * The last set slot is considered the valid position to which that ribbon will be placed/moved.
  * @param player_guid the player
  * @param ribbon the award to be displayed;
  *               defaults to `MeritCommendation.None`;
  *               use `MeritCommendation.None` when indicating "no ribbon"
  * @param bar any of the four positions where the award ribbon is to be displayed;
  *            defaults to `TermOfService`
