/**
  * In between the network side and the higher functioning side of the simulation:
  * accept packets and transform them into a sequence of data (encoding), and
  * accept a sequence of data and transform it into s packet (decoding).<br>
  * <br>
  * Following the standardization of the `SessionRouter` pipeline, the throughput of this `Actor` has directionality.
  * The "network," where the encoded data comes and goes, is assumed to be `leftRef`.
  * The "simulation", where the decoded packets come and go, is assumed to be `rightRef`.
  * `rightRef` can accept a sequence that looks like encoded data but it will merely pass out the same sequence.
  * Likewise, `leftRef` accepts decoded packets but merely ejects the same packets without doing any work on them.
  * The former functionality is anticipated.
  * The latter functionality is deprecated.<br>
  * <br>
  * Encoded data leaving the `Actor` (`leftRef`) is limited by an upper bound capacity.
  * Sequences can not be larger than that bound or else they will be dropped.
  * This maximum transmission unit (MTU) is used to divide the encoded sequence into chunks of encoded data,
  * re-packaged into nested `ControlPacket` units, and each unit encoded.
  * The outer packaging is numerically consistent with a `subslot` that starts counting once the simulation starts.
  * The client is very specific about the `subslot` number and will reject out-of-order packets.
  * It resets to 0 each time this `Actor` starts up and the client reflects this functionality.
